which is a type of truth about the state of things in its own way
lmao
diversity in general is good
we should always be trying to think of things in as many diferent ways as possible
this ties into my belief that diversity of thought is good
i am half serious tho
sorry
the method of the schizophrenic
I will keep swinging my hammer blindly then
uh okay
you hit the nail on the head
no
but maybe I read too much into what he said
because he wants to get away from that
i guess i was more focusing on teh connotation of saying he wants you to doubt
i see
okay
ah
and he says maybe they should doubt their doubt of everything
no i think you said it right
nice
oh shit
lol sorry
idk
sure
yeah
uh
yeah I got that part
and actually
yeah
lmao
add it to the poster

i came across somethign
but also
lmfao
the part that I share in this server
the part that I have to talk about
well
Now Kuromi will have access to my vault

hiiiiiiiiiiiiii
I was about to say that a forest is preferable
s
but there are some forest
unfortuantely there are no mountains near where i live
i do like nature
thank you
Lol nice
Explore nature
My guts say they want you to take a hike
Hmm
or when the frequencies simply clash
cancel eachother ou and neither are heard
frequencies
i mean
having learned to isolate and identify various subwaves
and all of the interpretation of sound we have comes from our brain processing the wavefunciton
so hearing has fewer dimensions than vision
and you get direction from having two receivers
alright i just wanted to verify that
In psych I learned that it was having two ears that allowed us to perceive direction
Probably not
Hmm
Not as well as we do now
if we only had one ear working would we be able to pick out the direction a soudn was coming from
we literally just pick up vibrations
Rip
in any case I give up on trying to defend this model
But sound has a ton of info
Just less precise info
I disagree heavily
because I think sound has lower information content than vision
but I think you could
I disagree
but here I go talking out of my ass again
and surfaces are 2d
you can only tell me the brightness and color values on the points of certain surfaces
but you cannot
Dang it
Broken grammar
So just your physical ability to receive input into your mind
Like sound and light
Wait
Context are still cubject to judgements that are there dimensional
Two images with no
That
I still think
because the two 2d pictures are not part of a single larger 2d picture
if you see a static image of a ball
infinitely ambiguous
but it is ambiguous
as we shift our perspective
each eye is its own screen that is synthesized together into a single image by the brain
you can think about our eyeballs like a screen
yep
yeah
yeah
yeah
sure
if you have a person who sees normally
it seems like it would have some really interesting applications
well
I still am curious what you were trying to get at with that tho
because I had a feeling that my attempt to think about this mathematically was bullshit
this is why I checked
okay forget it
stfu
Cringe
understanding how the eyes work is necessary for trying to grasp at how the output could be modeled
Oh then you should really only compare decibels to brightness
just the flow of information
I mean eyes are complicated
It derives depth from the difference in the two images
well your mind creates the sense of depth to help you visualize things
Pitch distance volume
The combination of right and left eye information is how our brain interprets depth
I see
But likkkkke
I see
I mean
it is
The intersection between two two dimensional planes  is three dimensional
Oh nvm
I mean
you have two eyes each give a different image
nah it would be an 8 dimensional concept with those measurements
Please tell me if I am insane
Well yeah
Do these people think
Wait
boomers do
do uh
woah
I didnt knwo this woudl happen
im very sorry
I think its done now
their path to their profession from college
